	\subsection{Grid world planning with Dijkstra's}
	Using figure \ref{fig:gridworld}, write out steps for Dijkstra's algorithm (\textbf{8-connected}, assume uniform cost for each action). At each step, list the grid cells in the open set with their running cost and the grid cells in the visited set. Write the final path found as a list of grid cell ids.\\
	\\
	\textbf{Solution:}\\
	
	On the following pages the calculation of the Dijkstra-Algorithm is shown. Our found path has a length of 7 and was found by always selecting the cell with the loweset index first, if there were 2 cells with the same cost.
	\\
	\\
	The found path is: $S \implies 33 \implies 26 \implies 27 \implies 20 \implies 21 \implies 14 \implies G$
	\\
	\\
	The set of the \texttt{visited} cells can be seen in the \texttt{Sel} column, for each step all the upwards entries of the column have been visited previously. Also the different sets with the currently \texttt{open} cells and their current costs can be seen in the vertical line of each step. If they have already been visited, the have no cost entry, if there has not been a path found the cost is listed with $\infty$ and the currently selected cell is listed in bold font, if it is selected and visited in the current step. \\
	In the last column \texttt{Pre} the previous cell of the selected cell is listed, so we can tranverse the found tree backwards from a certain goal-cell. The found path from Start to Goal is underlined in the \texttt{Pre} column.

	\subsection{Grid world planning with A*}
	Using figure \ref{fig:gridworld}, write out steps for A* (\textbf{8-connected}, assume uniform cost for each action). At each step, list the grid cells in the open set with their f-value (use Manhattan distance to the goal as the heuristic function) and the grid cells in the visited set. Write the final path found as a list of grid cell ids.\\
	\\
	\textbf{Solution:}\\
	
	On the following page the two possible runs of the A* algortihm are shown, the algorithms were aborted after the Goal was visited, as its cost cannot be improved afterwards. \\
	One of these is optimal (second one) and the first one is not optimal, since it returns not an optimal value for the path from Start to Goal. This is, because the heuristic is not \texttt{Admissible}, this means, it overestimates the distance from the current cell to the goal. Therefore, depending on the choice at step 5 (cell 12 or 21, both have a cost function \texttt{f} of $9$), we either get an optimal path or not.
	\\
	\\
	The first, not optimal path found is: \\$S \implies 33 \implies 26 \implies 27 \implies 20 \implies 12 \implies 5 \implies 6 \implies G$ (cost 8)
	\\ \\
	The second and optimal path found is:\\ $S \implies 33 \implies 26 \implies 27 \implies 20 \implies 21 \implies 14 \implies G$  (cost 7)
	\\
	\\
	Like with the Dijkstra algortihm, it is possible to see the set of visited nodes in the \texttt{Sel} column upwards and the current costs of the \texttt{open} nodes in the horizontal lines of the table. In the first row of the table, the cell-ID and its heuristic value (Manhattan-Distance to the goal) is shown.
